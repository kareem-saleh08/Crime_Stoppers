# Crime Stoppers Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes arrest data from Dallas, TX (2014–2021) and San Jose, CA (2015–2020) 
to identify patterns, correlations, and differences between the two cities.  
The goal is to explore relationships between drug and weapon involvement, demographic trends, 
and time-based arrest behaviors — ultimately providing insights for crime prevention and safety strategies.

## Research Questions
1. How do drugs affect weaponized crimes?  
2. Are there correlations between Dallas’s criminals, crimes, or arrest times?  
3. How does Dallas compare to San Jose in these trends?  
4. Are there any data gaps or missing patterns (“holes”)?

## Key Findings

### Weapons vs Drugs
- Expected: armed crimes would often involve drugs.  
- Actual finding: most armed crimes were unrelated to drugs.  
- Only about 25% of firearm-related arrests also involved drugs.  
- Conclusion: weapon use and drug involvement are mostly independent.  

---

### Gender Patterns
- Population gender is nearly even in both cities, but arrests are male-dominated:  
  - Dallas: 83% male arrests  
  - San Jose: 77% male arrests  
- Males are about four times more likely to be arrested than females.

### Race Comparison

#### Dallas
- Population: 23.6% Black, 42.4% Hispanic  
- Arrests: 43.4% Black, 0.78% Asian  
- The Black population is overrepresented in arrests compared to their share of the population.  

#### San Jose
- Population: 30.8% Hispanic, 2.9% Black  
- Arrests: 54.45% Hispanic/Latino, 0.85% Pacific Islander  
- The Hispanic/Latino population is significantly overrepresented in arrests.  

---

### Age and Crime
- Both cities show similar age-crime curves:  
  - Crime rises during late teens,  
  - Peaks in early 20s,  
  - Declines through the 30s.  
- Suggests a common behavioral pattern linked to age and opportunity.  

---

### Arrest Timing
- Arrests peak at night, when crimes are easier to commit or police patrols increase.  
- Fewest arrests near sunrise, possibly due to:  
  - People waking up (reducing opportunities),  
  - Police shift changes,  
  - Crimes occurring earlier and discovered later.  
- Important note: arrest time does not necessarily equal crime time — further study needed.  

---

## Future Work
- Reassess the drug–weapon relationship using expanded datasets.  
- Focus on firearm control for greater safety impact than drug control alone.  
- Explore why night-time crimes often go unaddressed or underreported.  
- Conduct time-matched studies to distinguish between crime occurrence and arrest timing.

Summary:  
The initial hypothesis linking drugs and weapon crimes was not supported by data.  
To improve safety, firearm control efforts appear more effective than drug policy interventions.  
Arrest timing, demographic disparities, and city-level differences provide valuable direction for future analysis.
